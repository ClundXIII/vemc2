Structure from vemc2
because of the previous bad structure of the
code there will be a new System, no overall
project, we will use libraries, etc.
Everything with console, and the end project
will be 'core'. (no lib)
If there is no GUI, it will do the Object
Management, too.
The physical effects will be in 'physics'.
The Objects have to use a 'physic helper'
(instead of the old MassPointHelper). -->
this will be a lib!
'graphik' will be the 3D OpenGL Graphic ...
really? YES ;D (a lib, too ...)
in header we need a link to all root headers
of all libs. (Maybe there will be a .deb
Package with symlink in /usr/include/vemc2)
'settings' will be the Settings manager ...
maybe with much Macros or huge Template
classes or boost support ... we will see ;)
